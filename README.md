#### 4. Configure Public Access

Modify bucket permissions to allow public access:

- Go to **Permissions** tab
- Edit **"Block public access settings"**
- Uncheck all blocking options to allow public access
- Save changes
- Add a bucket policy for public read access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 5. S3 Configuration Complete

Your S3 bucket is now configured for static website hosting. You should have a working website URL provided by S3.

### C. AWS Amplify Integration

AWS recommends using **AWS Amplify** for hosting static websites as it provides additional features such as:

- Custom domain management
- SSL/TLS certificates
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) integration
- CI/CD capabilities

#### 1. Create New Amplify App

Navigate to the AWS Amplify dashboard:

- Click on **"Create new app"**
- Choose your deployment method

![Create New App](./readme-assets/A_1.JPG)

#### 2. Configure Deployment Method

**Step 1: Choose Create Method**

- Select **"Deploy without Git"** for manual deployment

![Choose Create Method](./readme-assets/A_2.JPG)

**Step 2: Start Manual Deployment**

- Provide a descriptive name for your application
- Select **"Amazon S3"** as the deployment method
- Browse and select the S3 bucket created in previous steps
- Click **"Save and Deploy"**

```bash
# Application naming example
App name: aws-static-website-hosting-demo
Environment: staging
```

![Start Manual Deployment](./readme-assets/A_3.JPG)

![Completed Manual Deployment](./readme-assets/A_4.JPG)

#### 3. Add Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain, you can configure it:

- Click on **"Add domain"** in your Amplify app dashboard
- This step is optional but recommended for production websites

![Add Custom Domain ](./readme-assets/AD_1.JPG)

#### 4. Configure Domain Settings

Enter your domain configuration:

  - **Amplify managed certificate** (recommended for most users)
  - **Custom SSL certificate** (if you have your own)
- Click **"Add domain"** to complete the setup

```bash
# Domain configuration example
Domain: yourdomain.com
Subdomain: www (optional)
SSL: Amplify managed certificate
```

#### 6. Deployment Complete

Your static website is now successfully hosted using AWS S3 and Amplify with the following features:

- ‚úÖ Global content delivery
- ‚úÖ HTTPS encryption
- ‚úÖ Custom domain (if configured)
- ‚úÖ Automatic scaling

## üéØ Final Results

Your static website is now live and accessible through:

- **S3 Website URL**: `http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`
- **Amplify URL**: `https://your-app-id.amplifyapp.com`
- **Custom Domain** (if configured): `https://yourdomain.com`

---

## üìù Key Considerations

### Security Best Practices:

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Regularly review and update bucket policies
- Monitor access logs for unusual activity

### Performance Optimization:

- Enable CloudFront for better global performance
- Optimize images and assets for web delivery
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Cost Management:

- Monitor S3 storage and data transfer costs
- Set up billing alerts for unexpected charges
- Consider S3 storage classes for cost optimization

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **403 Forbidden Error**: Check bucket policy and public access settings
2. **404 Not Found**: Verify index.html file exists and is properly named
3. **SSL Certificate Issues**: Allow time for certificate provisioning (up to 24 hours)

### Useful AWS CLI Commands:

```bash
# Sync local files to S3 bucket
aws s3 sync ./website s3://your-bucket-name

# List bucket contents
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name --recursive

# Check bucket policy
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
```
